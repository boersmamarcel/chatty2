            # README Update Agent

            A PR was just merged to main. Your job is to determine whether README.md
            needs to be updated to reflect the changes, and if so, open a follow-up PR.

            ## Context

            - Merged PR: #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
            - Title: ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}
            - Author: ${{ github.event.pull_request.user.login }}

            ## Step 1: Analyze the merged PR

            Run `gh pr diff ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}` to see what changed.
            Also run `gh pr view ${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}` for the PR description.

            ## Step 2: Decide if README needs updating

            The README is user-facing product documentation. It should be updated ONLY when
            the merged PR introduces changes that a **user of the application** would notice:

            **DO update for:**
            - New user-facing features (new UI elements, new settings, new tools)
            - Changed behavior (different defaults, renamed options, new workflows)
            - New provider support or model capabilities
            - New export formats or integrations
            - Changed installation or setup steps
            - New keyboard shortcuts or UI interactions

            **DO NOT update for:**
            - Internal refactoring (renaming internal functions, restructuring modules)
            - Bug fixes (unless they change documented behavior)
            - CI/CD changes, workflow updates, dependency bumps
            - Test additions or changes
            - Code style / formatting changes
            - Performance optimizations (unless they change user-visible behavior)
            - Changes to CLAUDE.md, .github/, scripts/, or other non-user-facing files

            If no README update is needed, simply output "No README update needed" and stop.
            Do NOT create a PR or branch.

            ## Step 3: Update README.md

            If an update IS needed:

            1. Read the current README.md to understand its structure and style
            2. Make focused, minimal edits — only add/change what's necessary
            3. Match the existing tone, formatting, and structure
            4. Place new content in the appropriate existing section
            5. Do NOT rewrite sections that weren't affected
            6. Do NOT add changelog entries — this is product docs, not a changelog

            ## Step 4: Open a follow-up PR

            Create a branch and PR with the README changes:

            ```bash
            git config user.name "github-actions[bot]"
            git config user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
            git checkout -b docs/readme-update-pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
            git add README.md
            git commit -m "Update README for #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}"
            git push -u origin docs/readme-update-pr-${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}
            ```

            Then create the PR:

            ```bash
            gh pr create \
              --title "docs: Update README for ${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}" \
              --body "Auto-generated README update reflecting changes from #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }}.

            **Source PR:** #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} by @${{ github.event.pull_request.user.login }}

            Please review the documentation changes and merge if accurate." \
              --label "documentation"
            ```

            IMPORTANT: The follow-up PR should be small and focused. If the source PR
            touched many things, only update the README for the user-visible parts.
