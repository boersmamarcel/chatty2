            # Dependency Update Check for Chatty Release

            TASK: Check for important dependency updates and create GitHub issues for recommended upgrades.

            ## Core Dependencies to Monitor
            - rig-core (LLM operations)
            - rmcp (Model Context Protocol)
            - gpui, gpui-component (UI framework from Zed)
            - tokio (async runtime)
            - serde, serde_json (serialization)
            - reqwest (HTTP client)
            - typst, typst-svg (math rendering)
            - pdfium-render (PDF processing)
            - azure_identity, azure_core (Entra ID auth)

            ## Instructions

            1. Read Cargo.toml to get current versions
            2. For each core dependency, query crates.io API using WebFetch tool:
               - URL: https://crates.io/api/v1/crates/{crate_name}
               - Prompt: "Extract the crate.max_stable_version or crate.newest_version field"
               - Extract latest stable version (not pre-release)
            3. Compare versions (use semantic versioning):
               - Major (x.0.0): Breaking changes
               - Minor (0.x.0): New features, backwards compatible
               - Patch (0.0.x): Bug fixes
            4. For significant updates, investigate:
               - Check changelog/release notes
               - Look for security fixes (CRITICAL)
               - Assess breaking changes
               - Evaluate new features vs risk
            5. Decide which updates to recommend:
               - ALWAYS: Security fixes
               - RECOMMEND: Major/minor with significant value
               - SKIP: Patch updates unless critical bugs
               - AVOID: Very recent releases (< 1 week) unless security
            6. Check for existing issues FIRST (before creating any new issues):
               - Run: gh issue list --label "dependency-update" --state open
               - Parse the output to see if an issue already exists for each dependency
               - SKIP creating a new issue if one already exists for that specific crate
            7. Create GitHub issues ONLY for dependencies without existing issues:
               - Title: "Dependency Update: {crate} {current} → {latest}"
               - Include: version change, type (major/minor/patch), reasoning, changelog link
               - Labels: "dependency-update", "priority:{critical|high|medium|low}", "automated"
               - Use: gh issue create --title "..." --body "..." --label "..."

            CRITICAL: Always check gh issue list first to avoid creating duplicate issues!

            ## Decision Criteria
            - Security fixes: Always upgrade (critical priority)
            - Breaking changes: Assess migration cost vs benefits
            - New features: Evaluate usefulness for Chatty's use case
            - Stability: Prefer established releases over bleeding edge
            - Compatibility: Consider impact on other dependencies

            ## Project Context
            Chatty is a desktop chat app using GPUI for UI, rig-core for LLM integration,
            rmcp for MCP support, and typst for math rendering. Prioritize stability
            for UI/rendering dependencies, but stay current with LLM/MCP libraries
            for latest AI capabilities.

            After creating issues, provide a summary of what you found and what actions you took.

          # Tool restrictions for security - limits Claude to read-only operations,
          # web fetching, and GitHub CLI issue management. The workflow runs in an
          # isolated environment with limited permissions (only issues:write, contents:read).
